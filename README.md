# mkv2mp4
Matroska Media Container to mpeg 4 conversion

I'd like to play my media on an Xbox 360.  Currently my library is hosted on Raspbian running minidlna.

Unfortunately, only a few formats are supported and no more than 2 audio channels..

Prerequisites:
mediainfo, mkvextract, avconv, libvo_aacenc, MP4Box
